# post2mail - Take HTTP posts and mail the info out

## Usage
 
    (look over the code, change the email template perhaps?)
    See test-server/*.go for an example and some code to copy
    
## Using gmail as a smtp server
I currently use gmail to send mail through. You can get a unique random password from google called "App passwords". These can be revoked without changing your main password. See under Account >> Security.

## Todo
dunno? *shrugs*
